  utter_prenatal_diet:
  - text: "Eating well during pregnancy is so important for you and your baby's health!
I recommend focusing on a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
Foods rich in folic acid, like leafy greens, citrus fruits, and fortified cereals, are especially great for preventing neural tube defects.
Don't forget calcium-rich foods like milk, yogurt, or cheese to support your baby's bone development, and iron-rich foods such as spinach, beans, or lean meats to keep your energy up.
Oh, and try to avoid raw or undercooked food, soft cheeses, and unpasteurized dairy products—they can carry harmful bacteria. If you’d like, I can share some meal ideas!"

  utter_exercise_during_pregnancy:
  - text: "Staying active during pregnancy can be really beneficial! Light exercises, such as walking, swimming, or yoga, can help with blood circulation, reduce stress, and prepare your body for childbirth.
But remember, every pregnancy is unique. It's always a good idea to check with your doctor first to make sure your exercise plan is safe for you and your baby.
If you’re new to exercising, start slowly and listen to your body. Feeling tired or out of breath? It’s time to take a break. I can suggest some pregnancy-friendly exercises if you'd like!"

  utter_first_trimester_symptoms:
  - text: "Ah, the first trimester—it's such an exciting time, but it can come with some challenges too.
Many women experience nausea or morning sickness, which is pretty common in the early weeks.
You might also feel more tired than usual—your body is working hard to grow a tiny human! Breast tenderness, mood swings, and food cravings (or aversions) can also pop up.
It’s normal, but if anything feels overwhelming, don’t hesitate to talk to your doctor.
I can also share some tips to help with nausea or fatigue if you're interested!"

  utter_second_trimester_symptoms:
  - text: "Ah, the second trimester—many women find this to be the most comfortable phase of pregnancy!
      Nausea usually fades, and your energy levels might feel like they’re bouncing back, which is such a relief.
      This is also the time when your baby bump starts to show, and you might feel those first baby movements—it’s so exciting!
      On the other hand, some symptoms like back pain, leg cramps, or heartburn might make an appearance as your body continues to adjust.
      It’s a good time to enjoy this phase, but if anything feels off or you’d like tips for staying comfortable, I’m here to help!"

  - text: "Ah, the third trimester—you’re in the home stretch now! It’s amazing how close you are to meeting your baby, but this phase can bring some challenges.
You might feel more tired as your baby grows, and finding a comfortable sleeping position can be tricky.
Swelling in your feet and ankles, backaches, and Braxton Hicks contractions—those practice contractions—are all common as your body gets ready for labor.
As your baby drops lower in your belly, you might find it easier to breathe but might need more frequent trips to the restroom.
If you’d like some tips for managing these symptoms or preparing for labor, just let me know!"

  utter_pregnancy_anxiety:
  - text: "I'm so sorry you're feeling this way, and it's completely okay to feel anxious or uncertain about pregnancy.

They can help you sort through your feelings and make the best decisions for yourself.
